# Applied ML in Healthcare
Medical care is being transformed by advances in machine learning and the rising digitalization of health data. I am enthusiastic about contributing to this dynamic environment by encouraging creative, ethical innovation and mentoring the next generation of data specialists. In my current role, I work with an accomplished, multidisciplinary team of data scientists, engineers, consultants, and healthcare specialists to use RWD to accelerate the detection of rare and under-treated diseases and, ultimately, to improve patient health outcomes.

We use an array of ML techniques to unlock the potential of RWD. These include training supervised ML models on anonymized, longitudinal patient level data (PLD) to predict rare disease diagnoses, thereby facilitating timely clinical intervention. Additionally, these models assist in identifying patients with unreported or under-diagnosed medical conditions, thereby increasing the likelihood of treatment and improving prognosis. We also use unsupervised ML to discover clinically meaningful patient subgroups, revealing heterogeneity within patient populations. This enables more individualized patient care and balanced clinical trial recruitment. Lastly, our ML solutions require meticulous methodological design, extensive clinical expertise, and a strong commitment to Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

# Academic Work
I'm fascinated by the relationship between early brain development and human health and disease. My graduate research lab investigated the disruption of cellular developmental and metabolic processes in brain tumor pathogenesis. We also explored therapeutics that inhibit cancerÂ growth by targeting metabolic and epigenetic pathways in brain tumor stem cells.

During my postdoctoral fellowship, I explored how early life events might influence healthy brain function favorably or adversely. We focused on the impacts of adolescent social experience on myelin development in the prefrontal cortex, the portion of the brain responsible for higher level cognitive performance, as well as the influence of early life auditory experience on sound information processing in the auditory cortex.
