# ML and Healthcare
Healthcare delivery is undergoing a significant transformation, fueled by the advancements in ML and the growing digitization of health data. My passion lies in shaping this vibrant landscape by fostering innovative, ethically-conscious ideas and nurturing the upcoming generation of data specialists. In my current role, I collaborate with a talented, multidisciplinary team comprising data scientists, engineers, consultants, and healthcare professionals. Together, we use RWD to expedite the detection of rare and under-treated diseases, ultimately aiming to enhance patient health outcomes.

Our toolkit includes a broad spectrum of ML methodologies to unlock the potential of RWD. This involves training supervised ML models on anonymized, longitudinal patient level data to predict the onset of rare diseases, thereby enabling proactive clinical intervention. Additionally, these models aid in identifying patients with unreported or under-diagnosed medical conditions, thereby bolstering the chances of effective treatment and improved prognosis. We also deploy unsupervised ML techniques to uncover clinically relevant patient subgroups, unmasking heterogeneity within patient populations. This paves the way for more personalized care and balanced clinical trial recruitment. To ensure optimal effectiveness, our ML solutions demand a rigorously designed methodology, clinical subject matter expertise, and a dedicated focus on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

# Neuroscience Research
## Cancer Cell Epigenetics and Metabolism 
I'm intrigued by the relationship between brain development and our vulnerability to disease, such as brain cancer or mental illness. In brain cancer, cancer cells may revert to a less mature, less "differentiated" state by altering their epigenome, small modifications to DNA that help a cell maintain its identity, as well as undergo various metabolic changes that collectively allow the cells to divide uncontrollably. A subset of brain cancer cells called "brain cancer stem cells" are particularly hard to eradicate due to their ability to evade radiation and chemotherapy. My graduate research lab investigated novel therapeutics that  specifically target the metabolic and epigenetic pathways that sustain brain cancer stem cells to inhibit cancer progression.

## Sensory Experience and Neural Connnectivity 
During my postdoc fellowship, I dove into how early life experiences can either positively or negatively shape brain function. We focused specifically on how experience might influence the thickness of myelin - an insulating layer around neural axons that governs the speed at which electrical impulses travel along neural circuits and thus the rate of information flow in the brain. We investigated the impact of adolescent social experience on myelin development in the prefrontal cortex, an area responsible for higher-order cognitive tasks. Moreover, we explored how early exposure to auditory experiences affects myelin development and how this alters the processing of sound information in the brain.
