# Applied ML
Advances in ML and the growing digitization of health data promise to improve the quality of our medical care. I want to contribute to this evolving landscape by supporting creative, ethically driven innovation and training the next generation of data experts. In my current role, I work with a talented multidisciplinary team of data scientists, engineers, consultants, and health professionals, and with various types of health data (medical claims, EHR) to reduce the time to diagnosis of rare and under-treated diseases and to improve patient health outcomes.

# Academic Work
I am fascinated by the interaction between early life brain development and human health and disease. In my graduate studies, our lab focused on the disruption of cellular developmental programs in the pathology of brain tumors. We investigated therapeutics that target metabolic and epigenetic pathways in brain tumor stem cells to induce growth arrest.

As a postdoc, our lab research focused on early life experiences in promoting healthy brain function. We investigated the role of adolescent social experiences on myelin maturation in the prefrontal cortex and the effects of early auditory experiences on the processing of sound information in the auditory cortex.
