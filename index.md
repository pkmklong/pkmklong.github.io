## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

I am a curiosity-driven data scientist with a background in machine learning, life science research and biomedical commercialization. Iâ€™ve engaged with diverse healthcare stakeholders (e.g. pharma, providers, patients, universities) to develop custom machine learning solutions, such as diagnostic algorithms to accelerate the diagnosis of rare diseases. My passion is combining data with curiosity to make healthcare better for everyone. 


## Research Interests ðŸŒ±

* Applied ML in Healthcare - how can analytics and healthcare professional best collaborate to improve patient care?
* Data Interoperability - how can we make various health data play well together?
* Algorithmic Fairness - how can we ensure that data solutions provide equitable care for all patients?

I value supporting aspiring analytics professionals with their career goals. Feel free to reach out.
