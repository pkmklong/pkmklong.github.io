## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

Hi! My name's Patrick. AI and data digitization are rapidly changing our healthcare system. I'm passionate about guiding this transformation toward ethical and innovative solutions that foremost benefit patients. In my current role, I work closely with a multidisciplinary team of data scientists, engineers, consultants, and healthcare specialists to leverage real-world data (RWD) for faster detection of rare and under-treated diseases.

My career spans roles in AI/ML, tech transfer, and neuroscience. As a neuroscientist, I dove into understanding how abnormal brain development might make us susceptible to neurological diseases and how we can use this knowledge to find promising new therapies. In tech transfer, I assessed which medical inventions could become the next big thing. This included everything from ML applications for healthcare like diagnostic algorithms and computer vision, to digital health innovations such as mobile health and telemedicine, as well as therapeutic solutions like biologics, small molecules, and medical devices. The practical application of these skills and experiences in the world of AI and healthcare has been an exciting journey.

I am committed to sharing my knowledge and experience. I have been a volunteer mentor at Insight Data Science, where I supported fellows in applied machine learning and effective data science communication. I also enjoy serving as a mentor at various tech hackathons, championing teams in crafting innovative solutions for causes like disease prevention and economic empowerment. 

Feel free to connect or reach out if you're interested in discussing AI in healthcare, data science, or if you have an interesting opportunity to share. 

## Research Interests ðŸŒ±

* *Applied ML in Healthcare* - how can analytics and healthcare professional best collaborate to improve patient care?
* *Data Interoperability* - how can we make various health data play well together?
* *Algorithmic Fairness* - how can we ensure that data solutions provide equitable care for all patients?

I enjoy exploring ideas with curious minded individuals and supporting aspiring anaytics professionals in their career journey. Don't hesitate to reach out.
