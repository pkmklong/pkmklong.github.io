# Applied ML
Machine learning tools and the digitization of health data hold great promise for improving the quality of our medical care. I want to contribute to this evolving landscape by supporting creative, ethically driven innovation and training the next generation of data experts. In my current role, I work with a talented multidisciplinary team of data scientists, engineers, consultants, and health professionals, working with different types of health data to reduce time to diagnosis of rare and under-treated diseases and improve patient health outcomes.

# Academic Work

I am fascinated by the interaction between early life brain development and human health and disease. In my graduate studies, our lab focused on the disruption of cellular developmental processes in the development of brain tumors. We investigated therapeutics that target metabolic and epigenetic pathways in brain tumor stem cells to induce growth arrest.

As a postdoc, our lab research focused on early life experiences in promoting healthy brain function. We investigated the role of adolescent social experiences on myelin maturation in the prefrontal cortex and the effects of early auditory experiences on the processing of sound information in the auditory cortex.
