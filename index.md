## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

Hi! Iâ€™m Patrick. I'm a curiosity-driven data scientist with a background in machine learning, life science research and biomedical commercialization. I completed my PhD in neuroscience at the University of Vermont and postdoctoral training at Harvard University and the University of Michigan. In my current role, I work alongside various healthcare stakeholders (pharma, providers, patients, universities) to develop custom machine learning solutions, such as diagnostic algorithms to accelerate the detection of rare diseases. My passion is combining data with curiosity to make healthcare better for everyone. 


## Research Interests ðŸŒ±

* *Applied ML in Healthcare* - how can analytics and healthcare professional best collaborate to improve patient care?
* *Data Interoperability* - how can we make various health data play well together?
* *Algorithmic Fairness* - how can we ensure that data solutions provide equitable care for all patients?

I enjoy exploring ideas with curious minded individuals and supporting aspiring anaytics professionals in their career journey. Don't hesitate to reach out.
